# What is this?

It's a textarea based scientific calculator.  Visit the [Github Pages deploy](https://smedberg.github.io/sci-calc/index.html) and enter a formula.  It handles simple calculations, tracks units, and includes support for constants.  For example, you can enter:
```
mass = 3 kg
velocity = 0.5 * c
momentum = mass * velocity
```
and it will calculate
```
momentum = 449688000 kgâ‹…(m/s)
```

# Development

## Commands

* `npm start` to start local web server
* `pegjs -o src/SciGrammar.js src/SciGrammar.pegjs` to manually regenerate the parser from SciGrammar.pegjs
* `npm run test` to run tests locally
* `npm run build` to create optimized build
* `npm run deploy` to deploy to Github Pages

## Technology

Calculations are performed by parsing the text area line by line.  Parsing is done via a parser defined in src/SciGrammar.pegjs, which is compiled to Javascript code via [PegJS](https://github.com/pegjs/pegjs).  The parser does the calculations and combines units, returning a tuple of number and units (units is a string.)

## Future work

* Normalize and reduce units
* Calculate and track significant figures
* Add more advanced calculations, e.g. sin, arcsin, pow, etc.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
